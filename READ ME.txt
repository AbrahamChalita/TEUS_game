This is a project based on the mascot of my university Tec de Monterrey. The main character is called TEUS and the objective is to avoid being hit by the failed exams with a 69 score.
This project was our final delivery for the Advanced Programming class we took on our last High School semester, also at Tec de Monterrey. 

This game also had a built in functionality of sending the final score and level to the user, through a local server and predefined mail account. 


This was a project developed by three people:
-Abraham Chalita Núñez
-Miguel Cano Macías
-Alejandro Berdejo Zermeño


For this proyect we used basic knowledge in pygame and all we knew about python so far. We based our game on a project we found at the following link:
